[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/Mattlk13/hipchat.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

Atlassian-Connect-Express-hipchat (ACE) is a NPM module to help developers build HipChat add-ons using [HipChat Connect](https://developer.atlassian.com/hipchat/getting-started).
Building a HipChat add-on with ACE is relatively simple, as it generates most of the plumbing for you, using Node.js
and Express as the add-on server.

Express by itself is a web app framework for Node. atlassian-connect-express-hipchat
just provides a library of middleware and convenience helpers that make it easier to build HipChat add-ons.
